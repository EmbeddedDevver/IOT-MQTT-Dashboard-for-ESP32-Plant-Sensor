### Getting Started
1. Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js on your computer. The official Node.js website has installation instructions for Node.js: https://nodejs.org
2. The easiest way to test that node is installed is to run the "version" command in your terminal/command prompt and check that a version string is returned:```node -v```. The Nodejs package manager NPM should also have been installed, and can be tested in the same way:
```npm -v```
3. This website uses MongoDB
4. 
5. After that, run your web server using```node app.js```, visit http://localhost:3000, and you will see a message 'Hello World'
